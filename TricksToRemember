 Use the join method of the empty string to join all of the strings together with the empty string in between, like so:

>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> ''.join(a)
'abcd'


Use the list method to split the user input string into array 
>>> a=raw_input("Give a string)
>>> b=list(a)


# make it suitable for caseless comparison
>>> my_str = my_str.casefold()
